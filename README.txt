MSTC Attendance Tracking Program(ATP):

ATP is a website for MSTC instructors to track student attendance. The site offers the ability 
to log in with personal credentials. Instructors have access to easy student list importing. 
Classes for instructors can be created on the fly and students can either be imported or added individually. 
Once classes are created the program will track attendance for the current day. The site comes complete with
a forgotten password link for changing passwords. The site was built with no administrators in mind
meaning the site is self sufficient in that it dynamically creates tables. The main goal for the site
was to give instructors the ability to view their students' attendance records to report to financial
aid at the end of a semester. Reports can be viewed on page or downloaded.

Licensing:

This site uses the standard MIT licensing. Please view https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT for details.

Roadmap:

ATP has plans for a future release which will be noted here. Instructors should be given the ability
to edit past date attendance. Currently the site only allows for csv importing for the student lists.
The site should be able to read and write with any file types. Currently CourseID is 8 digits but needs to
allow for a 5 digit SectionID as well. This will require database restructing.
